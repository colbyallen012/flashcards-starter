# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract

In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line! A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

## Setup

Clone down the repo.

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Running `node index.js` to run the app. 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```
